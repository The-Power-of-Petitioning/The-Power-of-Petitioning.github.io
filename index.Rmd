This a website by [Sharon Howard](http://sharonhoward.org) for exploring and visualising data created by and for the [Power of Petitioning in the 17th Century](https://petitioning.history.ac.uk/) (TPOP).

In the first instance, I'll be focusing on [Cheshire petitions](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/cheshire) because I'm writing a case study on the county, and particularly on exploring themes that I want to think about in the case study. But later I hope to add some pages on other collections.

The second reason for the website is to give me a place for slightly more thought-out and smartened-up versions of visualisations I've posted from time to time on Twitter (and keep losing track of). But pieces are likely to remain quite short, with minimal discussion.
