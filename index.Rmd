This a website by [Sharon Howard](http://sharonhoward.org) for exploring and visualising data created by and for the [Power of Petitioning in the 17th Century](https://petitioning.history.ac.uk/) (TPOP).
Most pieces are likely to be quite short, with commentary focusing on explanation of the visuals rather than discussion of findings.

In the first instance, I'll be focusing on [Cheshire petitions](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/cheshire) because I'm writing a case study on the county, and particularly on exploring themes that I want to think about in the case study.

The second reason for the website is to give me a place for slightly more thought-out and smartened-up versions of visualisations I've posted from time to time on Twitter (and keep losing track of!). 


## Data

### TPOP collections

- Quarter Sessions:
  - [Cheshire QS](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/cheshire)
  - [Derbyshire](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/derbyshire)
  - [Staffordshire](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/staffordshire) 
  - [Westminster](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/westminster)
  - [Worcestershire](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/worcs-quarter-sessions)
- [House of Lords](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/house-of-lords)
- [State Papers](https://www.british-history.ac.uk/petitions/state-papers)

### potential extra datasets

- catalogues data (including more QS, Chester Assembly petitions...)
- printed petitions in EEBO-TCP (a small corpus of ~400 petitions)
- [London Lives Petitions](http://london.sharonhoward.org)

## Themes for exploration

- [petitioners](petitioners.html) (QS)
- [responses](responses.html) (QS)
- [topics](topics.html) (QS)

in preparation:

- contexts
- texts

Explorations will also hopefully be expanded beyond my current focus on Quarter Sessions petitions at some stage.
