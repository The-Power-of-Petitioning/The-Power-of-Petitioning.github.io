    "text": "The data\nThe data is available, with full documentation, from Zenodo.\nCheshire: I’m working with a sample of 613 petitions from the Cheshire QS files between 1573 and 1798. I photographed all surviving petitions from every year ending in -8 between 1608 and 1798, plus every pre-1600 calendared petition. (My estimate is that there are in total about 5000 petitions in the files.) TPOP transcribed all the 16th-century petitions and a 1-in-20-year sample for the 17th and 18th centuries (years -08, -18, -38, -58, -78, -98); I abstracted the rest, and encoded all the responses.\nFor the other four counties, I have a total of 1115 petitions (1589-1799). As I’ve noted elsewhere, the survival of petitions in these collections is much more patchy than for Cheshire. Also, the individual counties’ numbers are smaller (Derbyshire in particular has only 94 petitions).\nI’m using only responses written directly on the petitions. This may miss responses recorded in separate documents, though I haven’t found any extra information while consulting the Cheshire files. I’ve also examined the 17th-century Cheshire QS order books, but haven’t found additional responses there; they’re more useful for fleshing out the reasoning behind the brief summaries on the petitions.\nAbout 70% of the Cheshire petitions have some kind of annotated response and, since I couldn’t find further records of responses, I decided to treat the absence of a recorded response as a type of negative response. However, annotated response rates have turned out to be considerably lower (and quite variable) for the other counties, and I haven’t been able to check for additional sources for those collections. So this will need to be borne in mind when making comparisons.\nThe detailed coding categories:\n\ngranted = request granted in full\ngrant_part = request partially granted (eg smaller amount of relief than requested)\ngrant_cond = granted, but conditional on the petitioner doing something\nreferred = to be further investigated or mediated outside the court, usually by local JPs\nrejected_nil = rejection with only the terse annotation “nil/nihil” or “nothing”\nrejected = rejection with a reason given (including “absent”)\nno_response = no response written on the petition\nuncertain = an apparent response, but it couldn’t be interpreted (eg damaged or illegible).\n\nSimplified positive/negative:\n\npositive = granted, grant_part, grant_cond or referred\nnegative = rejected_nil, rejected, no_response\n\nI’ll exclude the small uncertain group from analysis (some may not even be responses), so I’m looking at 593 Cheshire petitions and 1083 others."

    "section": "Overview",
    "text": "Overview\nHow often do petitioners get what they want?\nOverall, 56.3% of the 593 Cheshire petitions received a positive response, which suggests is that petitioners to the Cheshire magistrates had a reasonable chance of getting at least part of what they wanted, but a positive outcome was far from guaranteed.\nHowever, petitioners in the other four counties appear to have been less likely to get a positive response, averaging only 28%. Westminster stands out with an exceptionally low positive response rate of only 7.9%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more detailed breakdown:\nCheshire: 229 (37.3%) requests were granted in full, 50 (8.4%) partially or conditionally and 55 (9.3%) were referred. 75 (12.6%) were rejected with a response and 184 (31%) had no response.\nThe other counties vary, but it’s clear that the main difference is no-response petitions. Westminster is so different from the other counties that it does suggest the possibility of very different recording practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, there are some broad similarities between Cheshire, Derbyshire, Staffordshire and Worcestershire. If negative response and no response petitions are combined, the differences between these four counties are less noticeable. Cheshire JPs were more likely to respond positively to petitions, but it seems they were also simply more likely to bother to annotate a negative response. Derbyshire magistrates were least likely, apparently, to refer petitions for further arbitration."

    "section": "In more depth",
    "text": "In more depth\nCould variations in responses point to factors that increase or reduce the chances of success?\n\npetition topics\nThe topics are a set of broad categories manually assigned by the project for QS petitions; a couple of topics with very low numbers (dissenting worship, debtors - &lt;10 petitions) have been merged into the “other” category.\nThe proportional bar chart on the left shows the detailed breakdown of responses (Cheshire QS only). The smaller chart on the right shows the % of positive responses and the size of the square indicates the relative size of the category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some categories, the numbers may be too small to draw any real conclusions. Even so, it’s noticeable that there is some relationship between the number of petitions in a topic and the likelihood of a positive response; that’s to say, smaller topic categories are less likely to get a positive response. The exceptions to this pattern are the largest category (litigation, 171 petitions and one of the lowest positive response rates at 44.4%) and employment (15 petitions, 73% positive responses).\nBut when analysis is extended to the other counties, the patterns are rather different and that possible correlation disappears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Cheshire has two very distinct clusters in positive response rates by topic size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the other counties there is no sign of the same clustering by topic size. But in terms of positive response %s there are some similarities in topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother feature to note is the unusually high percentage of conditional responses for cottage petitions; it was very common for a request to be allowed to build a cottage to be granted on condition of obtaining the consent of the lord of the manor.\n\n\npetition type\nVariations here appear to be much less noteworthy than previous categories of analysis.\nThree types\n\nsingle petitioner (413)\nmultiple named petitioners (72)\ncollective (eg “inhabitants of Nantwich”) (108)\n\nThere is very little difference in overall positive/negative responses to the three types, though single-petitioner petitions are slightly more likely to receive a positive response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe responses breakdown does show more variation. The single category is far less likely to get no response at all, and is most likely to have requests granted in full. (But, interestingly, collective petitions are most likely to have a reason given for rejection.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame breakdown for the other counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npetition gender type\n(Collective petitions excluded.)\nA summary of gender of all petitioners (but not additional subscribers) per petition:\n\nf = female only (128 petitions)\nm = male only (343)\nfm = mixed gender (26)\n\nAgain there is very little variation in positive response rates. I might have expected slightly more variation in this category as I know there are gendered variations in petition topics; I’ll need to explore this further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd again, the more detailed breakdown of responses shows up more subtle variations. It appears that petitions involving female petitioners were less likely to have requests granted in full and more likely to have their cases referred to JPs for further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther counties for comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Updated] Breakdown by topic as well as gender (excluding mixed gender).\nFor Cheshire:\n\nGreater tendency for female petitions to be referred is clear across multiple topic categories. (The only topics with a higher % of male referrals are ones that have very very few female petitions.)\nThe situation with fully granted requests is a bit more mixed, but most of the lower female % is probably accounted for by the two large (and very distinct!) categories of litigation and poor relief."

    "text": "Making petitioners count\nBy far most petitions were initiated by a single person (1209 petitions, about 70%). For the other 30%, the most noticeable feature is that petitions by groups of named petitioners are less common than those from collectives (with or without named subscribers): there were 330 collective petitions (including 39 on behalf of a named person(s)), compared to 189 petitions with multiple named petitioners (including 14 on behalf of someone).\nMoreover, the vast majority of named group petitions are by very small groups. 132 have just two petitioners, only 17 have more than five and just 3 petitions have more than ten. It seems likely to me that group petitions are often the work of close relatives or working colleagues. At least 60 group petitions include people who are married couples, are stated to be relatives or share surnames. There are further group petitions from constables, other local officials or business partners, directly concerned with shared responsibilities or work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows subscribers only, for petitions that have them, and excluding a tiny handful of petitioners with more than 50 subscribers. Once again, 1 is the most frequent number of subscribers, but there is a much longer tail. Subscribers average 9.4 per petition, cf. 1.25 petitioners. However, more than a third of collective petitions had no signatures at all (128); obtaining signatures was clearly not essential to support collective petitioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncounties\nThe proportions of solo / collective / group petitions can vary geographically.\nThe percentage of group petitions appears to be relatively consistent across the counties (except for Derbyshire); the main variation here is between single and collective, hinting at regional variations in petitioning cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopics\nBecause of the larger number of topics, it’s more effective to focus on the proportion of petitions by solo petitioners rather than the full breakdown. (This time, the size of squares is used to indicate the number of petitions in the group.)\nPetitions complaining about local rates and taxes clearly tend to be group/collective affairs, or at least presented as such (communities organising together to complain about unfair rate assessments compared to other towns or villages more often than individual complaints of unfairness compared to neighbours). Dissenters’ petitions, though a small category, are specifically applications to license places of worship and brought by local communities rather than single individuals. On the other hand, more predominantly solo efforts include petitions about military relief, poor relief and child support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchange over time\nThere may be a long-term shift towards solo petitioning, though it’s far from conclusive. For much of the 17th century the percentage of solo petitioners is relatively consistent; fluctuations become more noticeable after petition numbers fall from the late 17th century onwards. However, the overall 18th-century solo average (73%) is higher than that for the 17th century (69%), and the late-16th-century solo average is even lower at 49%."

So it’s clear that men were far more involved with petitioning as an organised collective or group activity. The absence of women as subscribers may imply that supporters were most often recruited on a household basis, with men signing as heads of households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing gender across counties: Staffs is noticeably lower female % (about 15%) than the other four counties (25-30%).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not very surprising that female participation also varies with petition topic (and this at least to some extent correlates with topics that were more or less likely to be solo vs group/collective); in particular very few women are involved in petitions about rates, while approaching half of petitioners for poor relief."

    "section": "Signing petitions",
    "text": "Signing petitions\nThere was no requirement to sign a petition and the majority of petitioners did not sign their petitions at all. Therefore, this is not an attempt to analyse signatures for evidence of literacy. But why did some petitioners sign their names if the majority didn’t bother? What, if anything, is the social/cultural/legal significance of a signature in a petition? It might not be the same as in witness examinations or other legal documents (for which signatures usually were required). So I’m curious as to whether there are any patterns of interest.\nI only have partial data for the untranscribed Cheshire petitions, so they’re excluded from this section. Overall, there’s some kind of signature for 24% of petitioners in the transcribed collections.\nIn transcriptions, signatures were also marked up for “type” of signature:\n\nmark\ninitial(s)\nautograph signature\nname written in the same hand as the main petition text\n\nThe last of these can be difficult to interpret. In most cases, it’s not because the petition was written by the petitioner; inspection of the Cheshire petition images indicates that the only instances of this were less typical petitionary letters. In some cases - certainly for subscribers - it looks possible that the petition is a copy rather than the original document. For petitioners it’s hard to be sure whether it’s a copy of an original autograph or a scribal decision to write out the name as a kind of pseudo-signature and so I’ll only include them in breakdowns by signature type.\nInitials are very rare (&lt;10, only 1 of which is for a petitioner) and so are counted with marks for this analysis. However, this in itself seems quite noteworthy, as I might expect them to be more common based on my recollection of other types of document in early modern court archives such as witness examinations. (Though I wouldn’t guarantee that my memory is reliable, and I’d need some data to verify this.)\nMoreover, as can be seen, even when combined marks and initials are not very common (only 2% of all petitioners signed this way, or 12% of signatures excluding scribal) - considerably less common, I suspect, than in witness examinations even though I might expect petitioners to be of fairly similar social status to witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same for subscribers, and here (since there are no “[none]” to worry about) the low percentage of supporters signing by mark/initials is really striking, at about 4% (excluding scribal). This carries some clear implications about the social status of subscribers, and potentially these rates could be compared to data from studies of literacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncounties\nNot for the first time, Derbyshire is anomalous and difficult to interpret because of its small numbers and gaps (and the high % of scribal “signatures” may say more about the county’s clerks and record-keeping practices than about its petitioners). Cheshire doesn’t offer the same excuse and the low % of petitioners signing is very striking. Worcestershire meanwhile has a considerably higher % of marks than the other counties.\nWestminster has by some distance the highest % of petitioner signing their names, and (notwithstanding my caveats) that probably really does reflect higher levels of literacy in London. But it seems less likely that literacy was substantially lower in Cheshire than in neighbouring Staffordshire and Worcestershire, so why are the % so much lower?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngender\nThe lower % of women signing their petitions with autograph signatures might come as no surprise. But this also highlights that petitioners who could not write their names didn’t normally choose to sign with a mark instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npetition topics\nAssociation between the presence of signatures and specific petition topics is very clear: again, even if this isn’t directly about literacy, there are obvious correlations between higher signing % and topics where you might expect petitioners to be of higher/middling status, and the lowest % of signing are mostly related to poor relief. (There’s no obvious relationship between signing and the size of a topic.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchange over time\nHere, however, there is a strong relationship between the popularity of petitioning and the % of petitioners signing their petitions, as well as the obvious change over time. (51 Westminster petitions couldn’t be dated to within a decade. However, all were from c.1620-1640 and none were signed by the petitioners, so they’d make very little difference to this picture.)\nBetween the 1610s and 1670s and in the 1690s (the rise in the 1680s is intriguing), signing rates never rose above 10% of petitioners. Also, even though numbers are relatively small, the rate seems consistently much higher in the late 16th century, around 25-30%. From 1700 signing rates rise dramatically again; from the 1710s they never fall below 50% and peak in the 90s in mid century.\n(It’s also worth remembering that petitioning declined much more sharply in Cheshire after the 1680s than in the other counties.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracking the % of petitions that have subscribers diverges from the chart for petitioners in some interesting ways. The % is consistently low in the first half of the 17th century, suddenly rises in the 1650s, falls again in the early 18th century before gradually increasing over the rest of that century. Could the sudden jump around 1650 suggest the influence of political revolution on collective activity in much more mundane areas of life?"

Derbyshire is particularly difficult (IIRC, more petitions were excluded than included). Westminster is also problematic; 44 petitions couldn’t be dated to within a single decade (though all were within the period 1620-1640), and these were not evenly distributed across topics.\nTwo counties, Cheshire and Staffordshire, have been sampled by the simple method of taking one year in ten. This is unlikely to be a significant issue for overviews and comparisons of gender. But it’s much more awkward for any attempt at chronological analysis. I’ve ignored that here and simply counted by decade. But I’ll probably need to think much harder about this before long."

    "text": "Comparing counties: three views\n\na bar chart\nThe colour coding here is not strictly essential but I find it helpful for comparing the different rankings of topics. It can be seen that the counties cluster into two groups with either litigation or poor relief as the most frequent topic of petitioning. Cheshire is unusual for the level of cottage petitions. Westminster has no cottage petitions because cities were exempted from the relevant legislation; more interesting is the frequency of petitioning about employment and infrequency of poor relief petitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nanother bar chart\nBut switching round the comparisons. (For convenience, “other” is excluded this time.) Suggests that within most topics there aren’t massive differences between counties; notable exceptions = Westminster/employment and Derbyshire/poor relief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmosaic plot\nThese are less common than bar charts, so a bit of explanation:\n\nthe relative size of each county is indicated by the height of the row\nthe size of each topic is indicated by the width of the rectangles. (When there are this many categories, it can become difficult to line up each rectangle with its label; I think this is hitting the limits really, even though I’ve excluded the two smallest categories and “other”.)\n\nSo you can compare the relative size of each topic for each county visually. But the colour coding takes things further.\n\nblue means that the topic is (statistically) over-represented\nred means that it’s under-represented\ngrey is neutral\nthe darker the shading, the stronger the statistical significance\nthe lines with a red circle represent 0s\n\n(The statistical measure is Pearson’s Chi-squared Test.)\nThis method can produce some surprises. Eg, litigation in Cheshire looks big, and it is the largest single county-topic combination with 177 petitions. But it turns out that’s slightly deceptive, because Cheshire just has so many petitions. (In the second bar chart, you can also see that two counties have a higher % of litigation petitions.) It does, however, confirm the impression that cottage petitions are unusually popular in Cheshire."

In this case, the “warm” cluster of petitions for military pensions in the 1650s dramatically highlights a legacy of the Civil Wars. But it indicates that a number of other topics were also at or near peaking around the middle of the 17th century. The heatmap also highlights the sparsity of petitions in many topics after 1700, except for the new topics of dissenting worship and imprisoned debtors."

Again, there are probably too many categories for this to be really effective, even though I’ve reduced the topics again. You can pick out a few things - eg female/poor relief, female/paternity; male/officeholding; na/rates - but it’s hard to get a good idea of their relative significance. On top of that it gives no sense at all of the big differences in size between the gender groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmosaic\nThe mosaic highlights the most important relationships more clearly.\nEg, female petitioners are strongly positively associated with poor relief and paternity, while the negative associations with alehouse, cottage, officeholding are somewhat weaker. Stronger associations for male petitions are negative ones with paternity and poor relief petitions. For collective petitions it’s all about rates (and it is common for “inhabitants” of a township or parish to group together to complain about taxes), but they’re less likely to be litigation-related.\nConversely, eg, although you can see in the bar chart a lower female than male % for military petitions, the difference is too small to register as statistically significant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmap\nThe strong association between mixed gender petitions and litigation stands out here too. It’s an intriguing one, even allowing for the small size of the group."
