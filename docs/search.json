But later I hope to add some pages on other collections.\nThe second reason for the website is to give me a place for slightly more thought-out and smartened-up versions of visualisations I’ve posted from time to time on Twitter (and keep losing track of). But pieces are likely to remain quite short, with minimal discussion.\ndata\nTPOP collections\nQuarter Sessions:\nCheshire QS\nDerbyshire\nStaffordshire\nWestminster\nWorcestershire\n\nHouse of Lords\nState Papers\npotential extra stuff\ncatalogues data\nprinted petitions in EEBO-TCP\nLondon Lives Petitions\nplanned themes\ncontexts\nresponses\ntopics\ngender\nsupporters\ntexts\n\n\n\n",

I’d like to compare with some of TPOP’s other transcribed collections, but that’ll take quite a bit of work which I don’t have time to do at present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m working with a sample of 613 petitions from the Cheshire QS files between 1573 and 1798. I photographed all surviving petitions from every year ending in -8 between 1608 and 1798, plus every pre-1600 calendared petition. (My estimate is that there are in total about 5000 petitions in the files.) TPOP transcribed all the 16th-century petitions and a 1-in-20-year sample for the 17th and 18th centuries (years -08, -18, -38, -58, -78, -98); I abstracted the rest, and encoded all the responses.\nI’m using only responses written on the petitions. This may miss a few responses recorded in separate documents, though I haven’t found any while consulting the files. I’ve also examined the 17th-century QS order books, but haven’t found additional responses there; they’re more useful for fleshing out the reasoning behind the brief summaries on the petitions.\nI’ve decided to treat the absence of a recorded response as a type of negative response given that there are high response rates generally - about 70% of the petitions have an annotated response - and responses don’t seem to be recorded anywhere else.\nThe detailed coding categories:\ngranted = request granted in full\ngrant_part = request partially granted (eg smaller amount of relief than requested)\ngrant_cond = granted, but conditional on the petitioner doing something\nreferred = to be further investigated or mediated outside the court, usually by local JPs\nrejected_nil = rejection with only the terse annotation “nil/nihil” or “nothing”\nrejected = rejection with a reason given (including “absent”)\nno_response = no response written on the petition\nuncertain = response (or probable response) couldn’t be interpreted (eg damaged or illegible).\nSimplified positive/negative:\npositive = granted, grant_part, grant_cond or referred\nnegative = rejected_nil, rejected, no_response\nI’ll exclude the small uncertain group from analysis (there are only 20, some of which may not be responses anyway), so I’m looking at 593 petitions.\nOverview\nHow often do petitioners get what they want?\nOverall, 56.3% of the 593 petitions received a positive response, which suggests is that petitioners to the Cheshire magistrates had a reasonable chance of getting at least part of what they wanted, but a positive outcome was far from guaranteed.\n\n\n\n229 (37.3%) requests were granted in full, 50 (8.4%) partially or conditionally and 55 (9.3%) were referred. 75 (12.6%) were rejected with a response and 184 (31%) had no response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more depth\nCould variations in responses point to factors that increase or reduce the chances of success?\n\n\n\n\n\n\npetition topics\nThis is a set of broad topics manually assigned by the project for QS petitions; a couple of topics with very low numbers (dissenting worship, debtors - <10 petitions) have been merged into the “other” category.\nThe proportional bar chart on the left shows the detailed breakdown of responses. The smaller chart on the right shows the % of positive responses and the size of the square indicates the relative size of the category.\n\n\n\nIn some categories, the numbers may be too small to draw any real conclusions. Even so, it’s noticeable that there is some relationship between the number of petitions in a topic and the likelihood of a positive response. The exceptions to this pattern are the largest category (litigation, 171 petitions and one of the lowest positive response rates at 44.4%) and employment (15 petitions, 73% positive responses).\nInterestingly, there are two very distinct clusters in positive rates.\n\n\n\nAnother feature to note is the unusually high percentage of conditional responses for cottage petitions; it was very common for a request to be allowed to build a cottage to be granted on condition of obtaining the consent of the lord of the manor.\n\n\n\nchange over time\n\n\n\nPre-1600 and post-1700 petitions have been combined because the annual numbers are very small. There were only 7 petitions in 1698, all of them for poor relief, so it’s difficult to be sure why the success rate was so exceptional in that year.\nThe JPs’ diligence in 1648 is particularly noteworthy; there were almost 150 petitions during that year, but only 22 have no response at all. Moreover, apart from 1698, it was the most successful year for petitioners.\nThere is a possible trend overall - the positive % rising until mid-century and declining afterwards - but 1628 and 1688 really confound any such pattern. Unlike topics, there are no clear clusters or correlations between petition numbers and positive %.\n\n\n\npetition type\nVariations here appear to be much less significant than previous categories of analysis.\nThree types\nsingle petitioner (413)\nmultiple named petitioners (72)\ncollective (eg “inhabitants of Nantwich”) (108)\nThere is very little difference in overall positive/negative responses to the three types, though single-petitioner petitions are more likely to receive a positive response.\n\n\n\nThe responses breakdown does show more variation. The single category is far less likely to get no response at all, and is most likely to have requests granted in full. (But, interestingly, collective petitions are most likely to have a reason given for rejection.)\n\n\n\npetition gender type\n(Collective petitions excluded.)\nA summary of gender of all petitioners (but not additional subscribers) per petition:\nf = female only (128 petitions)\nm = male only (343)\nfm = mixed gender (26)\nI might have expected slightly more variation in this category as I know there are gendered variations in petition topics; I’ll need to explore this further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the more detailed breakdown of responses shows up more subtle variations. It appears that petitions involving female petitioners were less likely to have requests granted in full and more likely to have their cases referred to JPs for further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
