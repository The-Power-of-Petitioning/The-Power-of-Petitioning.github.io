'I beseech ye give me leave amongst your many well wishers (though unworthy to be ranked in the number of your meanest friends) to pray as heartily as any that you may happily enjoy your rising fortunes. I hear you intend a Session at Worcester this day about the mending of highways which is a very charitable and good work and so is it also (if you think good) before going out of the County to take some course for the putting down of the superfluity of alehouses and common tippling houses of which kind we have no less than three in Crowle and that is two too many for one little village as I find by experience to my loss of servants and they very often to the loss of their money and wits. The nearest of these alesellers is James Careless and therefore the worst. The next in propinquity of neighbourhood is Richard Brinton a tenant to Mr. Symons of Aston and upheld by him in that capacity. Careless petitioned my Lord Bishop for a licence to sell ale because he was a surgeon and had many patients come to him for help and found it a great inconvenience for them to go to remote places for their diet and drink and in that respect obtained a licence (as I understand) with a limitation to sell ale to none but his patients. But now of late especially he far exceeds his bounds and entertains all comers as well by night as by day high and low rich and poor beggars and all none excepted. For example a poor wandering fellow came not long since to my door counterfeiting himself to be blind lame and taken most perilously with a shaking palsy which part of an infirm man in these several particulars he performed so artificially that he made my wife to take great compassion of him for besides meat and drink she gave him money and a piece of bacon which he no sooner had than he went away with a snail's pace halting downright and shaking and groping with his staffe till he thought he was out of sight and then he was an upright man on the sudden and without any lameness blindness quaking or quivering could find the way to Carless's house presently where he called for a pot of ale a pipe of tobacco and a pennyworth of eggs to fry with his bacon and Careless rose up from other company and sat down by him where my two witnesses left them who heard and saw all their passage and after told it to me and my wife. Another poor fellow who professed himself an extraordinary carder and spinner of woollen or linen was of late set a work by my wife to card and spin coarse wool for blankets and when he had gotten some money for his work to Careless he goes and there with another of my men spent the greatest part of the night till it was three o'clock in the morning or thereabouts and then they parted but the spinner made his way through the churchyard when finding two beggar women in the church porch gave a groat to the younger to lie with him when there was such a stir between them that there was taken out of his pocket about 16s. which he presently missed by feeling in his pocket for his money and made so great a noise in chiding and brawling one with another that being near my chamber I woke my wife who called up all my men to go into the churchyard and see what the matter was and by searching with a lantern and a candle there was found about a crown of it which he had again the rest was lost. In the meantime whilst the search was made I sent for the Constable to put the spinning man and the young woman in the stocks and so was ridden of them and their disorder and many more (which is too much to set down in a letter) Careless' ale distributed to all comers privately and being enjoyned to march to Sessions whether a well governed alehouse it is. I will now most humbly take my leave and receiving pardon for being so tedious . . . . will end. Your poor neighbour and servant to command Crowle 12st Sept. 1633. Tho. Cocks.'

And whereas on a Sabbath day 1615 there was much sport made in Longdon by morrices and danceings and because at evening service the same day they were forced to cease their sports some of the youths of Longdon procured a poor woman then being excomunicated to go into the church in service time and made another poor boy to follow her into the church and there to tell the Minister (being then saying the service of Almighty God) that this excomunicate person was in the church hoping thereby to put an end of God's service that so they might again return to their sports all which being done by the excomunicate person and poor boy as they were directed the Minister was thereby interrupted in God's service and the whole congregation much disturbed. And whereas upon Trinity Sunday 1616 the dancing again taking place in Longdon aforesaid your poor petitioner being then Constable there for the preventing and suppressing of these abuses endeavoured peaceably to take the minstrel there playing and to punish him upon the Statute against rogues. Thereupon one of the dancing company strake up your petitioner's heels and said he would break your petitioner's neck down the stairs there if he departed not from them and let them alone whereby your petitioner being much terrified by them departed and afterwards many other abuses were committed that year by the said company too long here to relate unto you. And whereas now again this present year 1617 they were again there dancing sports upon every Sabbath day whereby it is to be feared the like quarrels may ensue as before to the great dishonour of Almighty and contempt of his Majesty's laws and proclamation against the same. May it therefore please your worships that premises considered to make some order in this your open Sessions for the suppressing the profanation of the Lord's Day and so shall give commands to the High Constables of the ..... to see the same executed and your petitioner shall ever pray God for you in worship long to endure.

'I beseech ye give me leave amongst your many well wishers (though unworthy to be ranked in the number of your meanest friends) to pray as heartily as any that you may happily enjoy your rising fortunes. I hear you intend a Session at Worcester this day about the mending of highways which is a very charitable and good work and so is it also (if you think good) before going out of the County to take some course for the putting down of the superfluity of alehouses and common tippling houses of which kind we have no less than three in Crowle and that is two too many for one little village as I find by experience to my loss of servants and they very often to the loss of their money and wits. The nearest of these alesellers is James Careless and therefore the worst. The next in propinquity of neighbourhood is Richard Brinton a tenant to Mr. Symons of Aston and upheld by him in that capacity. Careless petitioned my Lord Bishop for a licence to sell ale because he was a surgeon and had many patients come to him for help and found it a great inconvenience for them to go to remote places for their diet and drink and in that respect obtained a licence (as I understand) with a limitation to sell ale to none but his patients. But now of late especially he far exceeds his bounds and entertains all comers as well by night as by day high and low rich and poor beggars and all none excepted. For example a poor wandering fellow came not long since to my door counterfeiting himself to be blind lame and taken most perilously with a shaking palsy which part of an infirm man in these several particulars he performed so artificially that he made my wife to take great compassion of him for besides meat and drink she gave him money and a piece of bacon which he no sooner had than he went away with a snail's pace halting downright and shaking and groping with his staffe till he thought he was out of sight and then he was an upright man on the sudden and without any lameness blindness quaking or quivering could find the way to Carless's house presently where he called for a pot of ale a pipe of tobacco and a pennyworth of eggs to fry with his bacon and Careless rose up from other company and sat down by him where my two witnesses left them who heard and saw all their passage and after told it to me and my wife. Another poor fellow who professed himself an extraordinary carder and spinner of woollen or linen was of late set a work by my wife to card and spin coarse wool for blankets and when he had gotten some money for his work to Careless he goes and there with another of my men spent the greatest part of the night till it was three o'clock in the morning or thereabouts and then they parted but the spinner made his way through the churchyard when finding two beggar women in the church porch gave a groat to the younger to lie with him when there was such a stir between them that there was taken out of his pocket about 16s. which he presently missed by feeling in his pocket for his money and made so great a noise in chiding and brawling one with another that being near my chamber I woke my wife who called up all my men to go into the churchyard and see what the matter was and by searching with a lantern and a candle there was found about a crown of it which he had again the rest was lost. In the meantime whilst the search was made I sent for the Constable to put the spinning man and the young woman in the stocks and so was ridden of them and their disorder and many more (which is too much to set down in a letter) Careless' ale distributed to all comers privately and being enjoyned to march to Sessions whether a well governed alehouse it is. I will now most humbly take my leave and receiving pardon for being so tedious . . . . will end. Your poor neighbour and servant to command Crowle 12st Sept. 1633. Tho. Cocks.'

As the Justices who made the order will all be absent I desire that the order may stand till the next Session that those Justices be there and that the money be brought in and if the order may not stand that some other parish may be assigned to aid us in the relief of our poor. You may move it that this order may be referred to Mr. Fleete and myself to consider of it who knoweth the state of the case better than any one else. I must also entreat you to be very mindful for the good of old Pollas who hath gotten letters for a petition that there may be a deduction from off others that his exemption may be the greater and for your pains taken herein I shall be much indebted with you.

'I beseech ye give me leave amongst your many well wishers (though unworthy to be ranked in the number of your meanest friends) to pray as heartily as any that you may happily enjoy your rising fortunes. I hear you intend a Session at Worcester this day about the mending of highways which is a very charitable and good work and so is it also (if you think good) before going out of the County to take some course for the putting down of the superfluity of alehouses and common tippling houses of which kind we have no less than three in Crowle and that is two too many for one little village as I find by experience to my loss of servants and they very often to the loss of their money and wits. The nearest of these alesellers is James Careless and therefore the worst. The next in propinquity of neighbourhood is Richard Brinton a tenant to Mr. Symons of Aston and upheld by him in that capacity. Careless petitioned my Lord Bishop for a licence to sell ale because he was a surgeon and had many patients come to him for help and found it a great inconvenience for them to go to remote places for their diet and drink and in that respect obtained a licence (as I understand) with a limitation to sell ale to none but his patients. But now of late especially he far exceeds his bounds and entertains all comers as well by night as by day high and low rich and poor beggars and all none excepted. For example a poor wandering fellow came not long since to my door counterfeiting himself to be blind lame and taken most perilously with a shaking palsy which part of an infirm man in these several particulars he performed so artificially that he made my wife to take great compassion of him for besides meat and drink she gave him money and a piece of bacon which he no sooner had than he went away with a snail's pace halting downright and shaking and groping with his staffe till he thought he was out of sight and then he was an upright man on the sudden and without any lameness blindness quaking or quivering could find the way to Carless's house presently where he called for a pot of ale a pipe of tobacco and a pennyworth of eggs to fry with his bacon and Careless rose up from other company and sat down by him where my two witnesses left them who heard and saw all their passage and after told it to me and my wife. Another poor fellow who professed himself an extraordinary carder and spinner of woollen or linen was of late set a work by my wife to card and spin coarse wool for blankets and when he had gotten some money for his work to Careless he goes and there with another of my men spent the greatest part of the night till it was three o'clock in the morning or thereabouts and then they parted but the spinner made his way through the churchyard when finding two beggar women in the church porch gave a groat to the younger to lie with him when there was such a stir between them that there was taken out of his pocket about 16s. which he presently missed by feeling in his pocket for his money and made so great a noise in chiding and brawling one with another that being near my chamber I woke my wife who called up all my men to go into the churchyard and see what the matter was and by searching with a lantern and a candle there was found about a crown of it which he had again the rest was lost. In the meantime whilst the search was made I sent for the Constable to put the spinning man and the young woman in the stocks and so was ridden of them and their disorder and many more (which is too much to set down in a letter) Careless' ale distributed to all comers privately and being enjoyned to march to Sessions whether a well governed alehouse it is. I will now most humbly take my leave and receiving pardon for being so tedious . . . . will end. Your poor neighbour and servant to command Crowle 12st Sept. 1633. Tho. Cocks.'

<p><em>Filtering:</em></p>
<p>All columns are filterable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text filters match any part of a cell; just start typing to see a list of possible matches</li>
<li>The year filter matches ranges using / as separator
<ul>
<li>eg “/1630” = up to 1630, “1630/” = 1630 and later, “1630/1630” = 1630 only, and “1630/1632” = 1630 to 1632</li>
<li>some petitions have year ranges rather than exact years. The range filter is <em>inclusive</em>: eg for petitions with the year “1620-1640”, it will match any of “1615/1625”, “1625/1635” or “1635/1645”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sorting:</em></p>
<p>By default, the table is sorted first by county and then by year.</p>
<ul>
<li>All columns are sortable by clicking on the header</li>
<li>Sort multiple columns using the Shift key</li>
<li>Empty cells are sorted to the <em>end</em> of the table</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="notes-on-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes-on-the-data">Notes on the Data</h2>
<p>More information about the dataset can be found in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7027692">dataset documentation</a> and in the <em>Introduction</em> for each county on <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/series/english-petitions">British History Online</a>. See also the explorations in <a href="../themes/">Themes</a>.</p>
<p>Many petitions are undated and the year has usually been derived from archival context (the date of a court file). As a result, very occasionally, the year might differ slightly from the date.</p>
