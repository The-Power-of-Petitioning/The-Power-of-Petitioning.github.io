<p><em>Filtering:</em></p>
<p>All columns are filterable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text filters match any part of a cell; just start typing to see a list of possible matches</li>
<li>The year filter matches ranges using / as separator
<ul>
<li>eg “/1630” = up to 1630, “1630/” = 1630 and later, “1630/1630” = 1630 only, and “1630/1632” = 1630 to 1632</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sorting:</em></p>
<p>By default, the table is sorted by year.</p>
<ul>
<li>All columns are sortable by clicking on the header</li>
<li>Sort multiple columns using the Shift key</li>
<li>Empty cells are sorted to the <em>end</em> of the table</li>
</ul>
