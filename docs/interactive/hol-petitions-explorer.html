Petition of Sarah Shoebridge (the poor widow of Thomas Shoebridge, deceased), John Berryman, Robert Cock, Francis Asplin, James Allison, John Byatt, and Richard Neale. E. Nottingham has been indebted to petitioners severally for the last six years in considerable sums for work done, etc., but has been refusing or delaying payment; and the sessions of Parliament have been so frequent that there has not been any interval of privilege long enough to enable them to sue him at law. Petitioners, fearing to be barred by the Statute for Limitations, pray leave to prosecute actions at law against him, or at least to sue out Originals, and summon him thereon, and procure a return thereof"],"reference":["PA HL/PO/JO/10/1/6","PA HL/PO/JO/10/13/3","PA HL/PO/JO/10/13/3","PA HL/PO/JO/10/1/7","PA HL/PO/JO/10/13/4","PA HL/PO/JO/10/13/4","PA HL/PO/JO/10/14/2/3319","PA

<p><em>Filtering:</em></p>
<p>All columns are filterable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text filters match any part of a cell; just start typing to see a list of possible matches</li>
<li>The year filter matches ranges using / as separator
<ul>
<li>eg “/1630” = up to 1630, “1630/” = 1630 and later, “1630/1630” = 1630 only, and “1630/1632” = 1630 to 1632</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sorting:</em></p>
<p>By default, the table is sorted by year.</p>
<ul>
<li>All columns are sortable by clicking on the header</li>
<li>Sort multiple columns using the Shift key</li>
<li>Empty cells are sorted to the <em>end</em> of the table</li>
</ul>
